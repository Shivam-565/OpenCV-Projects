# Basic Computer Vision Projects (OpenCV)

This repository contains two fundamental computer vision scripts implemented in Python using the OpenCV library. These projects demonstrate object detection using pre-trained models (Haar Cascades) and color-based image processing.

## Prerequisites

You need Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
